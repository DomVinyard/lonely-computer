So, your partner is having an affair! What now?

Lots of advice online about how to deal with infidelity but it’s all so sober and clinical, isn’t it. Removed and distant. Well, I found out yesterday. My partner of 10 years has been having a long-term affair. I didn’t suspect a thing. 

I said goodbye and got the next train to a big city alone to cope and piece it all together. Started writing this on the train actually. The writing will get more lucid as it goes on, I imagine. I’m pretty dazed at the moment. I’ll write the last sentence when I feel like the healing has properly started. That’s the plan anyway. 

Feels nice to have plans. Writing this is helping? I’ll try and stay away from the circumstances specific to my relationship. I don’t suppose it ultimately matters if yours was a long relationship or a short one, if there were kids involved or not, if communication seemed healthy or didn’t. I’ll focus on the self healing process and the emotions rather than the specifics or the level of betrayal you should feel, getting into degrees of heartbreak just seems petty at this point. 

Also I promise I won’t let this turn into a mawkish goodbye letter disguised as advice, I’ll jot down anything I learn about or experience that I think may help someone. Sigh. Hurts. 

The first 24 hours, before I left, was just a blur of tears and conversation. I tried to ask about everything I could think, all the details, so I would have more of the pain in one hit rather than in stages. Figure I’m in for a breakdown, I might as well get my money’s worth. Trust is totally impossible, arbitrary, but they seemed honest enough with the details.

My god does it hurt. So what do I do?

Well, first I read all the articles on Google about dealing with their... ‘sexual compulsivity’ or whatever the fuck branch of indiscretion this stuff is. I read all the same stuff you did. It’s very human and normal to have an affair, people do it all the time but none of the websites say that explicitly because it doesn’t help in the slightest so they all just skirt around it. Every one is capable of an affair, it seems... even you, if the circumstances were just right. I’m glad that it wasn’t me that did it though, that would hurt a lot more. Guilt is more guttural and rotten than jealousy I think. Guilt like that would hurt and poison me a lot more, I think. That’s just me personally. 

Alright, rules!

1. No getting drunk or any drugs.
2. No boring people with sad boo-hoo heartbreak stories. 
3. No casual sex with strangers. 
4. Eat and sleep and gym where possible. 

Ugh, it just doesn’t stop. The pain. It’s first and last thing. In the morning, at night. They are the worst. Thinking, thinking, such vivid pictures, like little silent, grainy horrific GIFs. I finished a book yesterday with a line 'Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, It might have been.' And that seemed nice. It’s nice to read profound things and be struck by that profoundness in a way that seems deserved; earned. Everything has more significance at times like this. Waves of terrible fear and loneliness. Confusion like nothing will ever be ok ever again. It will, I assume. It certainly doesn’t feel like it. 

The rule about eating and sleeping is the hardest. Can try to force yourself to eat but you can’t force yourself to sleep. The bags under my eyes, goodness me. I haven’t got sleeping pills but I might in a couple of days if I still can’t sleep. My god am I scared and confused. 

Sunrise again. Three days now since I found out but it feels like three weeks.

Waves of feeling especially pathetic, not quite sobbing away in the shower but very vulnerable. It’s all very teen angst, maybe that’s just me. You gotta get on with things though. Things to do. Letting myself feel like a martyr. That helps. Everyone is being nice to me. That helps. It’s good to pretend to be a martyr but I’m not, I did plenty of things wrong over the years, cause and effect. Some friends are very protective acting like I got cancer or something. Hushed apologetic tones.

Shock. I’m going to talk about shock and the different stages of healing. The internet says there are distinct stages “shock then depression then anger”. Maybe it’ll be like that. They all say shock is the first, when you first find out, and I’m maybe just coming out of it now after a few days so I’ll try and explain. Weird long moments of alarming calm. Shrugs. Meh, these things happen. Then shaken back to Earth by happy memories that are (I assume?) irreparably tainted. The shock bit is ok because the calm feels so normal, almost want to finish that chat you were having with them about the neighbour or what not. Weird eye of the storm shit going on.

Another sunrise. First night’s sleep last night. Maybe through sheer exhaustion. Sleep. God it feels better after some sleep. Haven’t looked at my photos. Or my Facebook or anything. I went on Facebook  quickly and turned my profile picture from a picture of us two into just an empty square because why not. Otherwise what, a picture of me looking all sad? (ha ha)

Periods of feeling totally dead inside. Another sunrise. Is this day 5 or 6? Somewhere around there. I’m glad I’m not at home, good god. There is no home, anyway. Being somewhere different is starting to feel important.

‘No big decisions for the first month’. I read that somewhere. So we haven’t technically even broken up. We have, though. Writing is definitely helping, I advise it. Strange dizzy spells, that’s lack of food I suppose. Gym, haven’t been to the gym yet. Remember the rules. Another sunrise. Shock definitely gone, no anger but some classic depression. Forcing myself to write this now, I was enjoying writing this a couple of days ago. What’s the point of anything etc. Could lie here all day staring at the ceiling, that would be my ideal day. 

Went out and bought new clothes. Felt better briefly. Another day, exactly one week. I’m not enjoying being a martyr anymore. I feel very lonely. The shock is gone, I think? Is it? I’m quite cross. Not angry like shouty or aggressive. Cross at all the lies and the wasted time. Seeing couples in the street is a bit weird. Not sad, just weird. I hope they’re all happy I suppose. Feel sanctimonious looking at them. 

Being one week in is certainly strange. The shock was such a strange high. Like a walking dream. This is not really like that anymore. Like the onset of a hangover. No muted rushes of “what the fuck is going on”. One week in I know what’s going on now. It hurts a lot. Little pangs of terrible pain. 

Wandering the streets at night like a ghost. Feels poetic. Hey, look at me, I’m all poetic. Ducked into a bar. Someone tried to dance with me but I shook it off. Now I’m thinking about who the first person I’ll kiss is. First person of my new life. Jesus it’s so weird. 

Another bar, club. It’s Friday night. I kissed someone. Felt an immediate sense of shame and loneliness. I guess I was drunk. I only had two glasses of wine but not eaten properly in forever so I guess I was a bit drunk. Updated rules, no getting even a bit drunk. No kissing strangers? I don’t know if that’s a good rule. I’ll have a think. Yes, I feel a profound sense of shame. It’s the next morning, I ran out of clean clothes so I’ve come out to get some. I fell asleep at 3am, woke up at 7am and now I’m wandering again. The same streets as last night. Still feel like a ghost, but now an ashamed ghost. 

Breakfast time. There’s a couple next to me and I think I could fall in love with either of them. They are laughing for each other, jokes just for each other. Hopefully the ashamed ghost at the next table won’t be too haunting for them. Ha ha, I made myself laugh at the table writing that. Self pity is alright, isn’t it. 

Breakfast again, another night. Less bad thoughts than before in any given hour. I had a smoothie and 4 cigarettes for breakfast, I took up smoking. It’s been 10 days. I’m fine! I’m chain smoking. Why would anyone smoke? It tastes like shit. I’m using one to light the next and it tastes like shit. 

Two days later again, my insight is getting thinner I think, I don’t suppose this journal will be much longer. I read it back and it doesn’t really do much for me. Perhaps it will help in the most passing sense if you’ve just found out and it’s one of the million things you’re reading to try and justify your worth. Where are we now? Two weeks in, not quite. I’m very intimidated by everything. I’m not good enough for whatever the fuck you need to be good enough for these days, etc. I’m sure that will pass too. I’m thinking of things to write now. It still hurts a lot sometimes. Right now, it’s very painful. It’s been ok for a couple of days but now I’m very scared again.

More than two weeks now. Needy, I miss cuddling. Overwhelmed. I don’t think about it all much, it’s easier to blank it all out. When I do think about it, a few times a day I feel needy and miss cuddling. 

I got drunk and had sex with a stranger. It’s been 2 and a half weeks, so much for rules. It’s the next morning and I don’t feel guilty about it. I have a nervous energy but I don’t feel guilty. I feel a bit guilty. That’s probably my own insecurities more than the act itself. I feel a bit low. I downloaded a ‘Stop Smoking’ audiobook. I hate smoking. I might find someone else to have sex with.

The stop smoking book was good. I don’t think I’ll smoke anymore. 

Three weeks but it feels like three months. Thought I was feeling better but ouch, not today. Woke up feeling very very lonely. Happy not to be smoking any more. That’s the best thing I feel like I have going for me at the moment.

Three and a half weeks. Nothing to add.

Four weeks. Spent all weekend drunk and now I feel like shit. No more getting drunk, I’m so so serious. Straighten the fuck up, it hurts really badly. 

Drank again Monday night and slept with another person. Feel dirty, fragile, alone. This needs to stop.

Month and a half now, this is all I’ve got. I’m out of things to write.

Two months. The healing has started. I haven’t slept with anyone else. The healing has started. Hang on tight, suffer through the pain, make a few mistakes and time will fix everything. The healing has started.

— 

Four years later. The healing hadn’t even begun to start. I spent two years as an addict, a third year destitute and a forth year getting better.

The healing has started.

What a weird lil' experience.
