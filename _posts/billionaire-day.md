Socialism was no longer required. They neutered capitalism instead.

A couple of decades earlier a date was set. January 1st 2055, "Billionaire Day". That was the day the billionaires were to be murdered.

It was notable for being the first petition to reach one billion signatures. A numeric irony. It’s important to note that the petition itself didn’t advocate direct violence, that's a misconception. The wording of the petition was translated into over 200 languages, but in English:

> *Extreme wealth will become illegal worldwide on January 1st 2055. I promise to enforce this ruling as a citizen of the earth.*

Nothing more. 

At some point, as the signatures rolled in, an invisible threshold of endorsement was crossed and it dawned that a new congress had been born. An institution unambiguously assumed, the office of the new earth, a billion names as credentials to make and enforce laws, the highest court signing itself into being.

Support for Billionaire Day grew nearly universal as the years ticked and the date wandered onto the horizon. The slogan “solved capitalism” and the symbol of the cause—a small blood-red dollar sign—was tagged on socials, sprayed on walls. It would eventually be found carved in flesh.

There were not many billionaires left to kill by the time the Day arrived (the threat alone had been enough to force most into charity or fugitism) but the first assassination rung loudly, a ratification in blood. It was actually before the stroke of midnight, the new law not yet technically in effect. The killer fired shots at a British billionaire and turned the gun on herself, she was a part of his own private security team.

And in this way the wealthy began to evaporate.
