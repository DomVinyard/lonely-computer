In the very middle of a deep wood. A crumbling castle.

Few walls remain. The ones that do resemble hedgerows with small flint flowers budding inside. No 4G coverage, no flight-path above. No motorway humming beyond the horizon.

The eastern wall is gone and a lake laps at the entire building from its open side. And the wall isn’t gone but drowned on the lakebed, protecting the sinking sand from the fish above.

There are no fish.

There’s only me. I sit on my moss-stained throne and shout imaginary orders at my imaginary courtiers (“FETCH ME MY HORSE! SUMMON THE DUKE!”). I send them away with a heavy nod and they carry out their duties precisely and without complaint. The court runs well.

A giant willow grows from the center of the throne room and drinks from the open lake. I make all of my best decisions under it. I skim stones across the water and watch them float along the sky until they evaporate into damp mist while the imaginary jesters chuckle. “One of these days..” I threaten, as the shadow of their caustic jeer echoes from wall to wall.

I hold court with imaginary money lenders and sentence the falsely accused. I smile with the left half of my mouth as imaginary harems of imaginary wives are paraded across my cracked tile floor. They brush aside the draping ivy with a sweep of their arm as though emerging from the beaded entranceway of a fairytale brothel. They adore me!

I am a fair king, they’ll say. I spend the day fighting for the dignity of my imaginary subjects. And when I start to yawn, I curl up on my throne and use my robe as a blanket to protect me from the ever deepening winter. I awake before dawn and watch the frozen sun rise above the lake, it licks at the edges of the throne and my shoes are never dry.

My favourite statue still stands at the end of the gloomy courtyards that consume my royal gardens. Sometimes I visit with a scythe and a flashlight to pull the bramble from the marbled figure of myself and look into his eyes. It’s good to be king.

I walk from room to room inspecting my life. There is no ceiling therefore the birds can respect me from above. A busy king, administering his busy kingdom.
