A dog got loose in the playground. The person that tasked me with catching him looks on, unamused. The dog bounds playfully back and forth, in and out of reach. “You’re not exceptional, you’re average”, he barks. Yeah. One day blends into the next and the dog remains uncaught, slightly older.

Older. The playground was sold into commerce, transformed into a petrol station forecourt. The dog has been there longer than anybody could remember and the person who tasked me with catching him has gone, long retired. The petrol station attendants watch us both, circling round and round in mock pursuit, “you wouldn’t know what to do if you caught me”, he barks. Nope. One evening blends into the next and the dog remains uncaught, slightly older. 

Older. The forecourt got shut down and now the wild grass eats at the edges, closing us in. The dog slipped away without much of a goodbye, bored, old, uncaught. I sit on the block of chipped concrete and imagine him still, one night blending into the next.
