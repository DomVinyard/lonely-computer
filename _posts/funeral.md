“It’s for the homeless man over there” I crooned, waving the computer on my wrist at the M&S cashier until she beeped. “The sparkling elderflower juice. It’s for the homeless man over there.”

She nodded, she didn’t even pretend to care.

“I joined the Labour Party”, I smiled at the homeless man as I handed over the unusually shaped designer bottle. “I joined the Labour Party. To put an end to all this.” I gesticulated clumsily at his huddled crouch.

He took the bottle, he didn’t even pretend to nod.

I’d smoked all of the cigarettes because I don’t want them in the house no more and there’s nothing to drink because I gave my sparkling elderflower juice to the homeless man. I was only pottering because there were no cigarettes left to smoke. And I’d been wearing a wet towel around my waist for an hour. Pitiful.

At a funeral of all places. The homeless man and M&S cashier were mourners but I didn’t know the dead guy and I was having trouble approximating empathy so I figured there was nothing to do but play it safe and broker an unambiguously ethical transaction. I’d be in the coffin soon enough and some other bastard would be redistributing. Only the living are giving, if you catch me.

So, the priest was a model hipster and he looked between me and the homeless man encouragingly. This is exactly the sort of impulsive, inconsiderate kindliness that bridges the 21st century with the faith, he mused. He realised with a start that he had been neglecting to drop his T’s and had already lost the attention of the attractive girl in the designer mascara that had just settled on a photo filter for her funeral selfie.

“Damnit” he gritted under his breath as he resumed the eulogy. He had soured the occasion for himself and his levee of regret was being held only by the air’s fragile reverence of death. It would break later.

“It was for the homeless man” the priest sighed, relaying the afternoon’s events. “The sparkling elderflower juice. And by the grace of god his towel remained firmly fastened.” The M&S cashier nodded, she was hanging around to reassure the priest. The attractive girl was back at home, laying on her bed with her beanie covering her eyes, disappointed that her funeral selfie had languished. She correctly blamed the mascara.

The homeless man had traded the sparkling elderflower juice for enough tobacco to roll three cigarettes. He should have just asked, I had absentmindedly brought another pack of twenty and smoked them all because I don’t want them in the house no more.

To potter. I put it down in writing and posted it into various indiscriminate postboxes around the town. “Would someone either sell me another twenty cigarettes or point me in the direction of a funeral. I’ve got literally nothing but time to kill.”
