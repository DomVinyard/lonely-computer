I called for a taxi recently, when it arrived it had a sticker on the back: “Any distance, any time.”

As I stepped into the car and slouched down onto the worn seat, a not-untypical drunkenness wriggling its way through my tired body, I began to ponder the first of those two clauses: “Any distance.”

I considered my life up to that point, my goals, my motivations. I wondered who I was and why; who I wanted to be. I considered happiness and success, satisfaction and contentment, purpose. I sketched out a reality and sighed.

Any distance.

I leaned forward and rapped on the glass. The driver swung round and met my eyes for a second before readjusting his gaze to the road ahead.

“Any distance?” I asked.

“Any distance.” he committed.

I don’t know why I said what I said, intoxication alone was not reason enough. The ideas formed themselves very consciously in my head and immediately resolved themselves as words.

“In which case”, I said purposefully, “I want to see the world.”

He shrugged and turned down the radio. “Where first?”

“South” I barked, immediately sober. “We’ll hit Europe by morning and we’ll keep driving; when we find bodies of water we’ll cross them, when we find mountains we’ll climb them, when we find hostilities we’ll defuse them. Us, mate. Me and you.”

And that’s what we did, me and him. Days passed and then weeks. The terrain around our little cabin shifted and morphed. Months and years flew by; over tarmac, dirt, sand. The hairs on our faces grew long as our friendship grew deep; only the cab and each other. We rarely spoke and never learned the other’s name because there was simply no need, all the time in the world but no time for triviality.
Continents blurred and countries became meaningless; the only border we recognised was that of the taxi; our embassy to the world.

Decades passed. Eventually we came to a long, unlit tunnel. As the radio sold its melody for static, the light from the entrance behind us faded and then disappeared completely. The entire world became impossibly dark; a darkness beyond the absence of light.

When the light returned and my eyes finally refocused, they did so to the familiar interior of the familiar cab. My visibly impatient companion was loudly repeating the words “£6.50. Mate, wake up. That’s £6.50.”

I glanced at the meter: ‘3 miles’. “Thanks.” I said, confused, as I stumbled out of the cab… “Mate”.

As I met his eyes, memories flashed through my head. The police we’d outrun and the war-zones we’d escaped, the marketplaces, temples and shrines in which we’d paid homage to human optimism, the friends we’d made, loved and lost. The hundreds, thousands, millions of miles we’d driven together in that now dilapidated old cab with its “Any distance” moniker faded but still visible against the rusted paintwork, blasted by sands from uncharteded deserts.

Me and him.

I stood, a drunk idiot grappling around my body for a loose note, desperately trying to find a way to communicate the blissful eternity we had shared together; the eternity that for some cruel reason lived in my head alone.

I found the note and while handing it over met his eyes for the last time.

“Keep the change” I coughed, and walked alone into the night.
